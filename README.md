# Movement Sense

Image Vision Project at Geometric Image Processing Lab (GIP) – Technion. As a part of a research study which aims to estimate age via sport exercise videos. The main goal of our project was to be able to generate accurate data out of samples captured by intel realsense depth cameras where subjects are performing sport exercises.

* Compared & tested AI pose estimation algorithms.
* Built a working pipeline, including: data collection, skeleton extraction, data calculation and results display.
* Comparing extracted data with Vicon(Gold-Standart) data.

Technologies:
OpenCV, Cubemos – skeleton tracking SDK, OpenPose - pose estimation, AlphaPose - pose estimation, Intel Realsense Depth Camera D415 / D435, Intel Realsense SDK.
